# Flood Forecasting

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is not
eligible for the [Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards
Program](https://bughunters.google.com/open-source-security).

The repository provides open-source replication of Google’s state-of-the-art flood-forecasting models. By open-sourcing these models, we aim to foster transparency, enable in-house integration in production systems, and accelerate academic research.

## Features
- Implementation of hydrology forecast models for gauged and ungauged basins.
- Data pipelines reading from public datasets: [Caravan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01975-w) and [Caravan MultiMet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09459).
- Pipelines for training, fine-tuning with historical data, and assimilating real-time data.
- The coding style and workflows in this repository are based on the open source GoogleHydrology library. All models are implemented using PyTorch.
