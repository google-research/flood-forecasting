# GoogleHydrology State Handoff Model Configuration File
# ==============================================================================
# DESCRIPTION:
# This configuration runs a test for the full CAMELS-US dataset. It is intended 
# as a medium-sized test for software development to ensure model stability 
# and performance across a standard benchmark before full-scale deployment.
# ==============================================================================

# --- 1. General Experiment Settings -------------------------------------------
# Basic identifiers and housekeeping for the experiment.

# Unique name for this experiment. Output folders will use this name.
experiment_name: camels-multimet-handoff-forecast-lstm

# Directory where model artifacts (weights, config copy, logs) will be saved.
run_dir: 

# Controls how much information is printed to the console during training.

# If True, PyTorch will try to find operations that cause NaN or Inf values.
