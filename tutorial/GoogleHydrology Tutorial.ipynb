    "# GoogleHydrology Finetuning Tutorial Notebook: Exploring Base Models and Targeted Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this interactive tutorial designed to help you understand the concepts of base hydrological models and the powerful technique of fine-tuning, using the `googlehydrology` framework. This notebook is structured as a student exercise, aiming to provide a hands-on experience in evaluating and improving predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "By working through this notebook, you will gain insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Understanding Base Models:** How a general-purpose hydrological model, trained on a diverse set of basins, serves as a foundation for further specialization.\n",
    "2.  **The Concept of Fine-Tuning:** The process of adapting a pre-trained model to improve its performance on a specific target or region that might be 'out-of-distribution' compared to the base model's training data.\n",
    "3.  **Running `googlehydrology` Models:** Practical experience in generating and understanding the command-line arguments for training (`train`), fine-tuning (`finetune`), and performing inference (`infer`) with the `googlehydrology` framework. You will learn how to prepare config files and execute these operations, typically in a terminal environment.\n",
    "4.  **Model Performance Analysis:** How to quantitatively evaluate model performance using various metrics (e.g., KGE, NSE) and qualitatively assess predictions through hydrograph comparisons.\n",
    "5.  **Impact of Static Attributes:** The critical role of static basin attributes (like basin area) in model performance and how targeted fine-tuning of specific model layers (e.g., `static_attributes_fc`) can address discrepancies when a target basin's characteristics differ significantly from the base model's training distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed insights into fine-tuning for river modeling, refer to the paper: Ryd, Emil, and Grey Nearing. \"Fine Flood Forecasts: Incorporating local data into global models through fine-tuning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.12559 (2025). [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12559)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a structured approach to guide you through the comparison of a **base model** and a corresponding **fine-tuned model**. The key steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Configuration:** Setting up local paths for model runs, shapefiles, and attribute data.\n",
    "2.  **Base Model Exploration:** Selecting a base model, visualizing its training and testing basins, generating its run commands, calculating performance metrics, and visualizing score distributions.\n",
    "3.  **Fine-Tuning Process:** Choosing a specific target basin for fine-tuning, understanding how to configure the fine-tuning run, and generating the necessary fine-tuning and inference commands.\n",
    "4.  **Fine-Tuned Model Analysis:** Selecting the fine-tuned model and loading its performance metrics.\n",
    "5.  **Comparative Analysis:** Directly comparing the base and fine-tuned models' performance on the target basin using both metric-versus-lead-time plots and detailed hydrograph comparisons.\n",
    "6.  **Basin Context:** Examining the basin area distribution of the training data relative to the fine-tuning target basin to understand the rationale behind targeted fine-tuning strategies, particularly concerning the `static_attributes_fc` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how to leverage pre-trained hydrological models and adapt them for specific regional challenges, ultimately contributing to more accurate flood forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed as an educational exercise rather than a performance benchmark. To ensure the code runs quickly in a standard environment (like Google Colab), the experiment is restricted to a \"toy\" dataset of only 5 training basins. Because State-of-the-Art (SOTA) global models typically require data from hundreds or thousands of basins to learn universal hydrologic behaviors and relationships, this 5-basin model will **not** yield state-of-the-art results. Specifically, a model trained on such a small sample size lacks the \"experience\" to understand basins in different climates or terrains. You will observe that performance metrics (NSE/KGE) on the 3 \"ungauged\" basins (basins not seen during training) are significantly lower than the training set. This is expected behavior from a model trained on a small (5-basin) dataset."

    "### Why is Basin Area Distribution Important for Fine-Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basin area distribution plot (from the cell above) is crucial for understanding our fine-tuning strategy, especially concerning the `static_attributes_fc` layer. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we fine-tune a pre-trained model, our goal is often to improve its performance on a specific, potentially 'out-of-distribution' target. The base model was trained on a set of basins, and its performance might be suboptimal for basins with characteristics significantly different from those it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Basin Area as a Key Characteristic:** Basin area is a fundamental static attribute of a catchment. If the fine-tuning basin's area falls significantly outside the range or distribution of the training basin areas (as visualized in the histogram), it suggests that the base model might not have learned a robust representation for basins of that particular size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Role of `static_attributes_fc` Layer:** The `static_attributes_fc` (static attributes fully connected) layer in the model is specifically designed to process these static basin characteristics (like area, elevation, geology, etc.). It learns to embed these attributes into a representation that the rest of the hydrological model can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Why Fine-Tune This Layer:** If our target fine-tuning basin has static attributes (like area) that are dissimilar to the bulk of the training data, the `static_attributes_fc` layer might be producing a suboptimal embedding for it. By fine-tuning *only* this layer, we allow the model to learn an improved, more accurate representation for the unique static characteristics of our target basin, without retraining the entire, more complex hydrological prediction part of the model. This targeted approach is more efficient and prevents 'catastrophic forgetting'—where retraining the whole model might degrade performance on the attributes it already learned well for the original training distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, if the target basin is an outlier in terms of area, fine-tuning `static_attributes_fc` directly addresses this discrepancy by teaching the model how to better interpret and utilize that specific characteristic for the target basin's predictions."
