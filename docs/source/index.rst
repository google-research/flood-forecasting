Welcome to GoogleHydrology's documentation!
===========================================

This is the documentation for the GoogleHydrology Python package.
The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/googlehydrology/googlehydrology/>`_.

On this documentation page, you'll find a :doc:`quickstart guide <usage/quickstart>` with step-by-step instructions on installation, required datasets, and command-line usage.
We've also written a few :doc:`tutorials <tutorials/index>` that walk you through code examples to train your first models.
The :doc:`modelzoo <usage/models>` lists all the models that come pre-packaged on installation (but you can add your own models, too).
Finally, the :doc:`API docs <api/googlehydrology>` show in-depth information on all modules, classes, and functions within GoogleHydrology.

You might also be interested in our `Research Blog <https://googlehydrology.github.io/>`_, where once in a while we post news about our papers and other projects.
